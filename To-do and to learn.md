# To-do 
DONE 1. Place icons in header. Shift layout to right, then shift two elements to left. Make a gray background.
DONE 2. Place logo icon. Shift nav menu to right. Make logo be on one line with havigation.
DONE 3. Make all content 70-80%(?) width.
DONE 4. Style cards into grid. Fix their size. Last row of card using different size - 50% of width (flex-grow?).
CANCELED 6. Make fixed height footer placeholder. Not planning to style it now.
DONE 7. Style grid with fixed size boxes. In the end of working on project I change them to stock photos.
DONE 8. Make footer.
9. Make simple mobile design. Add just one breakpoing for mobile. Tablets and such - when I want to polish site. 
Now I need to make it work, not look shiny.
10. Add Readme with gifs or similar stuff on how site animations look. Add general overview images. Add description of
how, why and what skills I used to do this site.
11. Blur logotypes. Change contact information to nosence.
12. Rename repo and deploy site to public. Make it available online if it free and can be quickly done.

## Style animations, hover states, font color and such.
DONE 1. Главная - on hover: color: red; style - underline.
DONE 2. Header nav buttons - on hover: bgc - --Main-color; color: white;
DONE 3. Find cc0 images for cards. Found CC BY 2.0.
4. Cards - add bg images. On hover: scroll animation color is --MAIN; font-color: on animation turning white. Image is on top 
and not changing. Animation time ~ 2 sec. When not hovering animation is slowly returning back. Myltiple animations can be played 
at once.
DONE 5. Buttons - on hover: bgc - --MAIN; color: white; Shadow some 5px;
DONE 6. Maps buttons - on hover: shadow some 5px red and gradient.

# To learn
DONE 1. How to download assets from Figma. Is it possible to download them from the project-task?
DONE 2. How to work with svg icons? How to style them and embed into HTML?
DONE 3. How to embed tel numbers in HTML?
DONE 4. How to work with grid (D. Gray tutorial)?
5. How to make animations?
DONE 6. Don't know how shadows are styled.
DONE 7. How to work with backgroundimages?

# For polishing
1. Add more breakpoints for diffirent screen dimensions. Style accordingly.
Or check if site is responsive without it.
2. Try to think about Главная / Для юридических лиц. What can be done to make it more apparent that it is portal/navigation to 
another page?
3. Change bg images to images with black background. So text will have consistent and ligible contrast.
